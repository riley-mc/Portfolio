#### The online portfolio created for and by Riley McAdoo, Oct. 16, 2020

#### By Riley McAdoo

## Description
This website will be my online presence for updating my code portfolio while enrolled with Epicodus. I imagine the site will be changing a lot over time with the additions of new rules, themes, frameworks, etc. 


## Setup/Installation Requirements

*  First open up your terminal and enter the following commands to navigate to the portfolio directory. Ensure you are in the Desktop.
    * cd portfolio
    * cd 



*  Turn on computer and open your preferred internet browser

*  Type in the link to my portfolio or click here (https://riley-mc.github.io/Portfolio/).

*  


## Known Bugs

Probably a few. I'm sure its mostly messy code and certain commands that don't even need to be in.

Things I would want to fix is the top portion with my name and quick description of the page. 

I also want to spend time on adjusting the fonts and sizing to look better with the page layout.


## Support and contact details

Feel free to email me at riley.mcadoo@gmail.com or DM me on Discord (riley#2607).


## Technologies Used

For this website I used GitBash for terminal commands, VSCode for the html, css and md files. Google Chrome was used as a browser for testing and reference.
