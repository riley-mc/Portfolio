## Description
This website will be my online presence for updating my code portfolio while enrolled with Epicodus. I imagine the site will be changing a lot over time with the additions of new rules, themes, frameworks, etc. 
## Setup/Installation Requirements


*  Look yourself in the mirror and say "You're Amazing!"

*  Turn on computer and open your preferred internet browser

*  Type in the link to my portfolio or click here (https://riley-mc.github.io/Portfolio/).

*  Enjoy! I'm open to any suggestions or help you have to give.

## Known Bugs

Probably a few. I'm sure its mostly messy code and certain commands that don't even need to be in.
## Support and contact details

Feel free to email me at riley.mcadoo@gmail.com or DM me on Discord (riley#2607).

## Technologies Used

For this website I used GitBash for terminal commands, VSCode for the html, css and md files. Google Chrome was used as a browser for testing and reference.
