  <!--I'm wondering if there is a better way to add a background image to my website. Most of the resources I found showed this sort of css rule directly in the html, so I'm not sure if this good practice or not. This was a first for me.-->

      <p> <strong> About Me: <p> </strong>
      <p> I was born in the Pacific NW where I grew up with a traditional white middle class family. I graduated from high school and quickly jumped into traveling around the world. I went to Southern Oregon University to study Communication Science. I am also very knowledgeable in the coffee world so ask me any questions you might have in regards to the beautiful bean juice. One of the big reasons I decided to enroll with Epicodus was because coffee, and most of the food service industry, took a big hit this year. Coding and development is something I've always been interested in, so with the state of the world I figured I should go for it now. When I'm able to I love riding my bike and rock climbing.</p>

        <h1> Monday Lesson </h1>
        </div>
        <div class="bg1">
          <p>Our first day started us off with great insight into the computers terminal and its relation to GitHub. We also learned some basick HTML, Block elements, inline elements, and what a README is.</p>
          <p><strong><em>A couple key notes from the day:</em></strong><p>
        <ul>
          <li> README is always written in .md and must always be included with any program or software. </li>
          <li> You want to try and use as little inline elements as possible. They are good for modifying or styling individual words or photos. 
          </li>
        </ul>
          <p>Here is a <span class="flashy"> <a href="https://github.com/riley-mc/hello-world-1"> link </a>
        </span> to one of my first github repo's. </p>

        <h1> Tuesday Lesson </h1>
        </div>
        <p>On Tuesday we started off with README practices, then jumped into the beginnings of css. We also went over the importance keep code clean and organized. From here we dove into Git Branching and Merging. </p>
        <p><strong><em>Points to remember</em></strong></p>
        <p>  </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Branching is the act of creating multiple copies of similar code in the same repository. </li>
          <li> $ git push rm master -f (this command is for updating a code that had been copied from my repo. Be sure to be in the directory of the one you want updated to.) 
          </li>

        <h1> Wednesday Lesson </h1>
        </div>
        <p>Wednesday was all about the start of learning to make a website look good. We were introduced to CSS where we learned about div, class, and other commands. Floats were also apart of the lesson even though I dont think I really like them, they are good to probably know.</p>
